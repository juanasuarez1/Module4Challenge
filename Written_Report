    For the PyCity School Analysis, we begin by creating a district summary. In this district summary we get basic information such as total schools, total students, average scores, etc. This helps us get an overall picture of everything. Next, we break down the data into school by school categories, adding variables such as school type and per school capita. We can further categorize the data by making categories of the averages for the school based on grade, school type, school size, or school spending.

    One of the conclusions we can draw from the data presented: School that achieved a higher spending rate per student actually acheived lower passsing percentages than schools than spent less per student. That is, the schools that spent less per student achieved higher passing percentages. An additional conclusion, charter schools scored significantly higher passing percentages than district schools.
